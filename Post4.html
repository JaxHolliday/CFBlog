                    <p>A favicon, also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, url icon and lastly a bookmark icon, is a file that contains one or more small icons that are associated with a particular site or page on the web. Favicons are not only useful for marketing and branding but also for usability. It really is an era of the internet and everyone browses different sites according to their wants and needs, favicon just helps them sort a particular website when the user opens multiple tabs. The human brain can remember images much easier than words. So, favicon helps users identify a website with a favicon on it. So if you have 10 tabs open and one of the ten is yours, you can just look in the tabs for your site's favicon to quickly identify it. </p>
                    <p>Favicons provide brand awareness. Everyone knows how a brand logo connects people visually and how important a logo is for a company. Logo’s give meaning for a brand of what it is all about. A favicon is like a miniature logo representing the company which helps users to remember the brand website much easier and gives a brand awareness for the company. Again, it’s like i said, your brain will recognize the image faster than words. For example, if I'm playing a game in which we are drawing images that we need to guess what they are drawing, and they put the logo for the nvidia graphics company. I use their products a lot and know the image be heart thus nvidia would be my answer. In simple terms, most people, companies and etcetera will often brand their product or company to an image that distinctly identifies themselves from the competition.</p>
                    <p>Whether your goal is to become a household name, to have a business recognized around the world, or to simply make waves locally, you need to build a unique brand for customers current and new to identify with. You can’t just use bland stock photos you find off google, you have to make something that describes you! You would want to find images, a logo and perspective that best defines what you're trying to convey that describes you or your product, whether you're selling yourself for freelance work or selling a product. Brand consistency is the pattern of expression that affects what people think about your service. Brand consistency helps keep you in context so people are more likely to remember you. It’s not magic Gandalf casted or some outrageous rule that brand strategists invented along the way, it’s how the human brain remembers things. Deep down to the root of it, it is psychological.</p>
