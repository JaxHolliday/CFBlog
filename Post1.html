                    <p>In today’s world, technology is ever growing with the development of 8k resolution capable TV’s to micro screens on smartwatches, the content being developed to be viewed and interacted with varies a lot these days. But designing for all these different devices is more work than what most people would actually think. I have found at the start of my journey, it involves a lot of complexity: designers have to maximize user experience for each device that uses it due to the fact users think the application was made for the device it appears on instead of magically fitting to the screen it shows up on.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some research/knowledge that I've found out on this starts with Identifying what the core user experience will be, in which case is why it exists. What it does is that it solves a problem people have and by that, it becomes meaningful and provides them value. A user experience is a combination of key content and features that represents the core user experience. If you want to find it just ask yourself: What are the most common/important tasks that the person needs to complete?</p>
                    <p>There may be a plethora of devices with varying screen sizes, but it’s impossible to target just a single device. It is, however, possible to target a group since users engage in different interaction modes depending on screen type. Think of you using the mobile version of a desktop website you regularly visit. I find that you would want the content you are trying to view to be consistent across the board.  Lastly, creating a seamless experience across different device groups is extremely important for your users. People freely move back and forth between devices to get things done, and when they are shifting from device to device, they expect their products and services to shift with them.</p>
